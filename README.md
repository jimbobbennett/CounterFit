# Virtual IoT Hardware

IoT is great fun, but has a downside - hardware. You need access to a range of devices such as sensors and actuators to build your IoT projects. Sometimes you might have these devices, other times you may not - maybe you are waiting for a delivery, or parts are out of stock, or they are just too expensive.

That's where this tool comes in.

## What is Virtual IoT Hardware

This is a tool that is designed to simulated various IoT hardware components, such as LEDs, buttons, temperature sensors and the like. It is made of three parts:

* A virtual IoT application - this is a web application where you can define what hardware you want on your device
* An SDK - this is an SDK for you to call, either from an app on your computer, on on the relevant hardware
* Shims - these mimic popular SDKs so you can take code that runs against well known hardware and run it against the virtual IoT device.
